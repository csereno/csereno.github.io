If you buy something on the list at a different store, I think you can mark that it’s been purchased so no one else buys it. 

I’ve noticed in the past (and even twice since I’ve been updating lists lately) that sometimes Amazon’s prices get way higher than what I originally added the item for. So if something seems ridiculously high and not reasonable for the product, I most likely did not add it at that price - and don’t buy it at that price!!!  Lol. 

Let me know if you have any questions!
