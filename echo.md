The Amazon Echo has number of voice-activated commands you can make use of. Here are a few of our commonly used ones:

_Our Echo is programmed to respond to 'echo.'_

## General
+ Set a timer
+ Tell a joke
+ Good morning (provides a summary for the morning)
+ Sing a song
+ Kitchen questions such as how many cups are in a quart

## Plex
Our Plex server is connected to the Echo. Here are some useful commands:
+ Tell Plex to play Fisher Price Sunday School Sing Along
+ Tell Plex to play _movie/song/show_
+ Tell Plex to pause
+ Ask Plex what was recently added?

## Netflix
To our knowledge, the Echo cannot control Netflix content. Please use our Roku remote or app for Netflix :)
