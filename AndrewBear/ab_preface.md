This collection of stories was told by a dad using what little creativity he could muster for original bedtime stories when books weren't enough. Some of them make sense, some are silly, some have morals, some are short, and some are long. It all depended on the level of creativity at the time, energy, kid participation, etc. It started as a single story/idea and then became a regularly requested part of the bedtime routine. What is written down is not verbatim to what was said. These are just the pieces I can remember!
